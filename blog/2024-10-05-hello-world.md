For a very long time, I've thought about writing some blog posts.

On one hand, I feel like there are so many accomplished authors, thought leaders, and engineers out there. I don't have much to share that isn't already better said by someone else.

On the other hand, maybe some of the things I write and share will be useful to someone. I also would encourage others to write and share their own thoughts, so maybe I should try embrace and live that advice myself.

I think I have some unique perspectives and experiences, that I hope will be useful to others that stumble upon this blog.

Some main things I really want to write about are

- "Beyond senior" engineering - There are so many amazing resources for learning about programming and software engineering these days, but I think there is still a lot more value in me sharing my own experiences and advice on how more junior folks can learn and grow to senior and beyond, standing on the shoulders of giants like Will Larson and Tanya Reilly.
  - [staffeng.com](https://staffeng.com/)
  - Tanya Reilly's [Glue work](https://www.noidea.dog/glue)
  - ["Technical" skills](https://sashalaundy.com/writing/technical-skills/)
- The manager pendulum - I love and share Charity Majors articles on this often, and would love to share more about it.
- Developer Experience, SRE, Infrastructure, and Platform Engineering - Where I'll share even more praise for Camille Fournier's work that I'll touch in the previous sections too.

And some other things maybe a little less "technical" or specifically engineering related that might be more generally accessible and interesting to folks

- Mental health and burnout
- Queer activism and intersectional feminism
- Community management
- Some reviews and recommendations of books, music, movies, and series that I enjoy.
